Problem: 
- startups have ideas, need competetive s/w teams.
- building s/w teams(roles/communication/processes) is hard 
- they dont hire freelancers, as the find hard to trust.

what we can provide : 
- complete freelancing teams, instead of lone freelancers
- team has experience/best practices for same tech stack as you deliver(we start with specific thing at first)

payments/benefits/terms/condition will be negotiated between clients and teams.

Now we ask for freelancers to register as teams, we setup our architectures, templates, practices and also assist teams to ensure best quality.
